/**
 * Repair a run manifest from the evidence on disk.
 *
 * A job can finish its work and still leave the manifest stale: the runtime
 * that was carrying it can die between the worker writing evidence and the
 * bookkeeping being recorded. That happened for real -- a Codex subagent was
 * killed when its parent process exited, after the worker had already written
 * a complete report. The work was not lost; only the manifest was wrong.
 *
 * The rule this encodes: evidence on disk outranks the manifest. But the repair
 * is deliberately narrow -- it only fills in jobs that never reached a terminal
 * state, and never rewrites a verdict that was already recorded. A reconcile
 * that could overwrite results would be a second way to lose them.
 *
 * A job with no evidence file is left alone and reported as such: it may still
 * be running. Deciding that it failed is the dispatcher's call, not this
 * script's, because only the dispatcher knows whether the runtime is still up.
