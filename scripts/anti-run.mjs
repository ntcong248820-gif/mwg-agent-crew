/**
 * Run one Antigravity job and refuse to call it a success without proof.
 *
 * Two transports, same contract:
 *   headless  `agy -p` -- fast, no UI, returns structured JSON with duration
 *                         and token usage. The default.
 *   app       `agentapi new-conversation` -- creates a real conversation in the
 *                         Antigravity 2.0 desktop app so the user can watch it,
 *                         then polls the conversation store until it settles.
 *
 * Why the evidence gate exists: agy has been observed returning
 * status=SUCCESS with an empty response and no work done, when a tool it needed
 * was blocked by a permission prompt it could not show. A worker that reports
 * success without writing its evidence file is therefore treated as failed.
 * The only trustworthy signal is a file on disk inside the task folder.
 *
 * And the order matters as much as the gate: agy's verdict is collected first
 * but judged last, by judgeJob() in crew-guards.mjs. Asking the runtime first
 * cost two finished jobs on 2026-08-24, recorded as failed on an agy ERROR
 * while their evidence was complete.
