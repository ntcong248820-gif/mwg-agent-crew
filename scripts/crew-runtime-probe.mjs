/**
 * Read the Codex runtime a run is actually sitting on, at the moment of asking.
 *
 * The manifest already records `transport` -- what the dispatcher chose -- and
 * `role` -- why it chose it. Neither says what the machine did with that
 * choice. A headless job and an app job can both end up on a shared broker or
 * on a private process, and the difference decides whether a second concurrent
 * run shares one runtime or starts its own.
 *
 * Why this is read twice per run rather than once (đo 25/08/2026): the reading
 * is not stable. `sessionRuntime.mode` came back `direct` at 21:47 and `shared`
 * at 22:05 with nothing dispatched in between -- the broker had come up on its
 * own. A single pre-run reading describes a machine that no longer exists by
 * the time the jobs land, which is why the manifest stores `atDispatch` and
 * `atSettle` and never a single value.
 *
 * Two independent sources, deliberately:
 *
 *   1. The companion's own `setup --json` (`sessionRuntime.mode`). This is the
 *      runtime answering about itself, so it is the authority. Measured cost
 *      0.45-0.52s, paid twice per run.
 *   2. `broker.json` under the plugin's state directory. Free to read, and it
 *      carries the broker pid -- which the companion's answer does not -- so it
 *      is what distinguishes a live broker from a stale file.
 *
 * The state directory name is `{basename}-{sha256(abspath)[:16]}`, confirmed
 * against the live path on 25/08. That is the plugin's private scheme, so the
 * file is treated as corroboration that may vanish, never as the primary
 * answer: if the plugin renames its state layout, `mode` still comes back
 * correct from the companion and only `brokerPid` goes null.
 *
 * Nothing in here throws. A probe is a diagnostic, and a diagnostic that can
 * break a dispatch is worse than no diagnostic -- every failure lands in the
 * returned `errors` array instead.

/**
 * How many app-servers are up, and which of them belong to this workspace.
 *
 * A raw count is the wrong number (đo 25/08/2026). Five matching processes were
 * live on this machine at once and only three were ours:
 *
 *   18224  ChatGPT.app's own app-server
 *   55831  the VS Code extension's app-server
 *   65720  the plugin broker (app-server-broker.mjs), ppid 1
 *   65736  node wrapper `codex app-server`, child of the broker
 *   65737  the native binary, child of 65736
 *
 * So an unqualified count is a number that changes when the user opens VS Code,
 * which makes it useless as run evidence. Servers are attributed instead: ours
 * are the ones whose ancestry reaches the broker, and everything else is
 * reported separately as foreign rather than silently added in.
 *
 * Two more distinctions the count has to make:
 *
 *   - The broker is not an app-server. Its command line contains the substring,
 *     but it is the process that owns servers, so counting it inflates ours by
 *     exactly one.
 *   - One app-server is two processes: the node wrapper and the native binary
 *     it spawns. A matching process whose parent also matches is the child, so
 *     servers are the ones whose parent is outside the set.
 *
 * `ps -Ao pid,ppid,command` only -- `pgrep -fc` does not exist on this macOS
 * and a probe must not depend on a flag that differs per platform.

 * dispatch, the runtime can be asked directly, so the knowledge reconcile was
 * missing is now available to it rather than the rule being relaxed.
 *
 * Measured on 25/08/2026, and two of these were not what the plan assumed:
 *
 *   - An unknown id exits 1 and prints plain text, not JSON. Detection is by
 *     exit code; parsing the message would be reading an error string.
 *   - A job from seven hours earlier was still retrievable by id, while
 *     `status --all` listed nothing at all. So "absent from the job list" is not
 *     evidence of anything, and `result <id>` is the only usable oracle.
 *   - A running job carries a live pid; a finished one has `pid: null`. That is
 *     what makes "the runtime says running but its process is gone" a safe
 *     orphan test rather than a way to kill live work.
 *
 * `alive` is deliberately three-valued. `null` means the question could not be
