/**
 * Attribute working-tree changes to the jobs of a crew run.
 *
 * A worker is allowed to write its evidence and its own data, and nothing else.
 * Checking that with `git status` alone does not work in this workspace: the
 * repo normally carries several hundred modified files of the user's own, so a
 * plain diff reports files no run ever touched.
 *
 * So attribution is by time: a file counts against a job only if it was
 * modified inside that job's own interval. Per-job matters. A run-wide window
 * once charged 32 skill files to a run whose only job never started -- the user
 * was editing those files in the same five minutes, and a window spanning the
 * whole run had no way to say so.
 *
 * Where a runtime says which files it wrote, that beats the clock: a hit is
 * labelled `authored` and charged to the job that named it, even if the mtime
 * only lands in a different job's window.
 *
 * But `authored` is a one-way signal and the label must not be read as a
 * ranking. Measured 2026-08-25: both runtimes fall back to a shell command when
 * their file-writing tool refuses -- Antigravity's `write_to_file` errors on any
 * path outside its own artifact directory, so its workers reach `run_command`
 * routinely -- and nothing written that way passes through the tool that reports
 * file changes. So a file a runtime names is certainly that job's; a file it
 * does not name may still be. `inferred` is therefore charged exactly as hard as
 * `authored`. Downgrading it would let every shell-written violation through.
 *
 * False positives are reduced without weakening that, three ways: a file another
 * run's job authored is reported as that run's; the run records where HEAD was so
 * the gate can say commits happened that it could not see inside; and a path can
 * be dismissed by name with a written reason that lands in the manifest.
 *
 * Two limits are deliberate and documented rather than papered over:
 *   - a write that was committed is invisible here, because only the working
 *     tree is read; workers are not supposed to commit, and a gate that shelled
 *     out to `git log` would still not know who authored a commit. `headSha`
 *     turns that from a silent gap into a reported one;
 *   - a job that died without recording an end time has no knowable interval,
 *     so anything found in its capped window is reported as suspect rather than
 *     charged as a violation. Failing hard there made the gate unpassable on
 *     exactly the runs it exists for, which teaches a dispatcher to ignore it.
