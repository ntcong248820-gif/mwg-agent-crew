/**
 * A stand-in for the Codex plugin's codex-companion.mjs.
 *
 * It exists because the app transport cannot be tested against the real thing:
 * that would need the Codex app running, would cost tokens, and could not be
 * made to fail on demand. The failure shapes are the point of these tests.
 *
 * The JSON shapes below were measured against companion 1.0.5 on 2026-08-25 --
 * a fixture invented from the plan's guesses would have tested the wrong
 * contract, which is exactly what nearly shipped:
 *   task --background --json  ->  { jobId, status, title, summary, logFile }
 *   status <id> --wait --json ->  { workspaceRoot, job, waitTimedOut, timeoutMs }
 *   result <id> --json        ->  { job, storedJob: { ..., result, rendered } }
 *   storedJob.result          ->  { status, threadId, rawOutput, touchedFiles, reasoningSummary }
 *
 * Driven by env so the adapter's own argv stays untouched:
 *   FAKE_COMPANION_MODE     ok | failed | timeout | no_job_id | not_json | crash
 *   FAKE_COMPANION_RESULT   ok (default) | empty | crash | no_result
 *                           -- the reply lookup fails independently of the job,
 *                              because a job can succeed and still lose its text
 *   FAKE_COMPANION_EVIDENCE absolute path the fake "worker" writes
 *   FAKE_COMPANION_BODY     what it writes there ("" writes nothing)
 *   FAKE_COMPANION_MARKER   file that records which subcommands were called
 *   FAKE_COMPANION_RACE     none (default) | no_job_found:<n> | no_status:<n>
 *                           | no_status_waited:<n>  -- same missing status, but
 *                             waitTimedOut true: the call did wait, so this is
 *                             a broken answer rather than a store catching up
 *                           -- the two shapes measured when two app jobs were
 *                              dispatched in the same instant: the store either
 *                              denies the id it just handed out, or answers with
 *                              a job carrying no `status` at all. Stateful: it
 *                              misbehaves for the first <n> `status` calls and
 *                              then answers normally, because that is what the
 *                              real thing does -- the condition settles.
 *   FAKE_COMPANION_RACE_STATE  file used to count those calls across processes
