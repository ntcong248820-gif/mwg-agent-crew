/**
 * The runtime reading, the app-server count, and the orphan rule.
 *
 * All three exist because a measurement contradicted an assumption, so the
 * cases here are written against what was measured rather than against the
 * shape the plan first described:
 *
 *   - an unqualified app-server count is wrong, because ChatGPT.app and the
 *     VS Code extension each keep one up permanently;
 *   - one app-server is two processes, so counting processes double-counts;
 *   - the broker's command line contains the substring but is not a server;
 *   - a running companion job carries a live pid and a finished one carries
 *     none, which is the only reason the orphan rule is safe.
 *
 * The orphan cases inject a probe rather than calling the companion: the rule
 * is the part worth testing, and a test that needed a live runtime could not
 * cover the case where the runtime has forgotten the job.
 *
 * Run: node mwg-agent-crew/tests/runtime-probe.test.mjs
